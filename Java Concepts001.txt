Java Concepts and Topics

=========================================================
Work with Arrays in Java
	 char vowels[] = new char[5];
	char vowels[] = {'a', 'e', 'i', 'o', 'u'};
Arrays are data structures containing multiple values of the same data type in sequential memory locations. Arrays can be of any primitive or non-primitive data type.

Since arrays are reference types in Java, new is required to create new instances.
Arrays can not be printed like regular variables. You'll have to use a loop or you'll have to convert the array into a string. 

first element in an array will have 0 as its index 

You'll need to first import the java.util.Arrays; and use the Arrays.toString() method to convert the array to a string. 


============================================================
String

if (input.length() <= 10) in this we are applying the restriction that if the String has less than or equal to 10 characters into that then accept it.

========================================================

BufferedReader>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>

BufferedReader is class used to read text inout efficiently(Especially large input)
	* It reads text line by line instead of character by 	character.
 Why do we use BefferedReader?
	*Faster than Scanner.  *Uses a buffer(temp-memory)
 Where does it read from?
	System.in: an input stream that reads data entered 	from the keyboard.

Difference betwee String name="ZI"; and String name=new String("ZI");

The JVM maintains a portion of your computer's memory for storing strings. This portion is called the string pool.

Whenever you create a new String in the literal way, the JVM first checks if that String already exists in the pool. If it does, JVM will reuse it. If it doesn't, then the JVM will create it.

On the other hand, when you use the new operator, the JVM will always create a new String object no matter what.
